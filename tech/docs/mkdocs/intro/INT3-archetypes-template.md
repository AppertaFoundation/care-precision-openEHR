title: "openEHR archetypes and templates" 
summary: This section provides a basic overview of openEHR archetypes and templates 
---

An openEHR CDR consumes, retrieves and queries patient healthcare data using a standardised open specification and querying format defined by [openEHR International](https://openehr.org). 

THis provides a way for clinicians to define and share open-source, vendor-neutral clinical information components
(`archetypes` and `templates`) which can be consumed, persisted and queried by different technology stacks, as long as they adhere to the openEHR specifications. 

Examples of archetypes used in this project are `Procedure`, `Symptom`, and `Imaging result`. These are managed by
the openEHR International using the [Clinical Knowledge Manager](http://openehr.org/ckm) tool and mirrored to [Github](https://github.com/openEHR/CKM-mirror), with a CC-BY-SA licence.

A repository of archetypes and templates designed for UK use is maintained jointly by the Apperta Foundation at [Apperta CKM](https://ckm.apperta.org/) and is mirrored to a [Git repository](https://github.com/AppertaFoundation/apperta-uk-ckm-mirror).

These make use of many of the archetypes on the international CKM< but have additional UK-specific archetypes and templates, intended to help harmonise use across the 4 UK countries and Ireland.
